##  Research Interests

- **Graph & Hypergraph Neural Networks** (DE-HNN for circuit netlist representation)  
- **Differentiable Optimization over Permutations** (with rounding guarantees)  
- **ML Infrastructure & Many-body Potentials** (MB-Fit framework)  
- **Neuroscience & Memory Consolidation** (verbal long-term memory via fMRI)

##  Selected Publications

1. **DE-HNN: An Effective Neural Model for Circuit Netlist Representation**  
   - AISTATS 2024, CoRR 2024 :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
   - Introduces a **Directional Equivariant Hypergraph Neural Network**, modeling netlists as directed hypergraphs. Achieves **universal approximation** under permutation equivariance/invariance and outperforms SOTA models in place-and-route outcome prediction :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.

2. **Differentiable Extensions with Rounding Guarantees for Combinatorial Optimization over Permutations**  
   - CoRR 2024 :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
   - Presents the **Birkhoff Extension (BE)**: a differentiable, continuous, polynomial-time computable extension from permutations to doubly stochastic matrices. Guarantees efficient rounding without loss of objective value and enables gradient-based optimization for permutation objectives :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.

3. **Human Brain Activity & Functional Connectivity for Verbal Long-Term Memory Consolidation (1-Month fMRI Study)**  
   - Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, February 2024 :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
   - Identifies brain activity and connectivity shifts (e.g., hippocampus, vmPFC) over memory aging from 1 hour to 1 month, supporting standard systems consolidation theories :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}.

4. **“Short Blanket” Dilemma for Neural Network Potentials of Water**  
   - J. Chemical Physics, February 2023 :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
   - Highlights the trade-off: DNN potentials can replicate MB-pol liquid water accuracy but fail on vapor-liquid equilibrium due to poor many-body interaction learning.
