##  Research Interests

- **Graph & Hypergraph Neural Networks** (DE-HNN for circuit netlist representation)  
- **Differentiable Optimization over Permutations** (with rounding guarantees)  
- **ML Infrastructure & Many-body Potentials** (MB-Fit framework)  
- **Neuroscience & Memory Consolidation** (verbal long-term memory via fMRI)

##  Selected Publications

1. **DE-HNN: An Effective Neural Model for Circuit Netlist Representation**  
   - AISTATS 2024, CoRR 2024 :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
   - Introduces a **Directional Equivariant Hypergraph Neural Network**, modeling netlists as directed hypergraphs. Achieves **universal approximation** under permutation equivariance/invariance and outperforms SOTA models in place-and-route outcome prediction .
